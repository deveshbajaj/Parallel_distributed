His head halted moment top staircase level
roof

Dont mope day said Im inconsequent Give
moody brooding

His head vanished drone descending voice boomed
stairhead

And turn aside brood
Upon loves bitter mystery
For Fergus rules brazen cars
Woodshadows floated silently morning peace
stairhead seaward gazed Inshore farther mirror
water whitened spurned lightshod hurrying feet White breast
dim sea The twining stresses two two A hand plucking
harpstrings merging twining chords Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering dim tide

A cloud began cover sun slowly wholly shadowing bay
deeper green It lay beneath bowl bitter waters Fergus
song I sang alone house holding long dark chords
Her door open wanted hear music Silent awe pity
I went bedside She crying wretched bed For
words Stephen loves bitter mystery

Where

Her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered musk
gaud amber beads locked drawer A birdcage hung sunny
window house girl She heard old Royce sing
pantomime Turko Terrible laughed others sang

I boy
That enjoy
Invisibility
Phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed

And turn aside brood

Folded away memory nature toys Memories beset
brooding brain Her glass water kitchen tap
approached sacrament A cored apple filled brown sugar
roasting hob dark autumn evening Her shapely
fingernails reddened blood squashed lice childrens
shirts

In dream silently come wasted body within
loose graveclothes giving odour wax rosewood breath
bent mute secret words faint odour wetted ashes

Her glazing eyes staring death shake bend soul On
alone The ghostcandle light agony Ghostly light tortured
face Her hoarse loud breath rattling horror prayed
knees Her eyes strike Liliata rutilantium te
confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat

smokeplume mailboat vague bright skyline sail
tacking Muglins

I read theological interpretation somewhere said bemused
The Father Son idea The Son striving atoned
Father

Buck Mulligan put blithe broadly smiling face He looked
wellshaped mouth open happily eyes
suddenly withdrawn shrewd sense blinking mad gaiety He moved
dolls head fro brims Panama hat quivering
began chant quiet happy foolish voice

Im queerest young fellow ever heard
My mothers jew fathers bird
With Joseph joiner I agree
So heres disciples Calvary
He held forefinger warning

If anyone thinks I amnt divine
Hell get free drinks Im making wine
But drink water wish plain
That I make wine becomes water
He tugged swiftly Stephens ashplant farewell running
forward brow cliff fluttered hands sides like
fins wings one rise air chanted

Goodbye goodbye Write I said
And tell Tom Dick Harry I rose dead
Whats bred bone fail fly
And Olivets breezy Goodbye goodbye
He capered towards fortyfoot hole fluttering
winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering fresh
wind bore back brief birdsweet cries

said

slow growth change rite dogma like rare thoughts
chemistry stars Symbol apostles mass pope
Marcellus voices blended singing alone loud affirmation
behind chant vigilant angel church militant disarmed
menaced heresiarchs A horde heresies fleeing mitres
awry Photius brood mockers Mulligan one
Arius warring life long upon consubstantiality Son
Father Valentine spurning Christs terrene body
subtle African heresiarch Sabellius held Father Himself
His Son Words Mulligan spoken moment since mockery

church Michaels host defend ever hour
conflict lances shields

Hear hear Prolonged applause Zut Nom de Dieu

Tarentum sir

Very good Well

There battle sir

Very good Where

The boys blank face asked blank window

Fabled daughters memory And yet way
memory fabled A phrase impatience thud Blakes wings

masonry time one livid final flame Whats left us

I forget place sir 279 B C

Asculum Stephen said glancing name date

That phrase world remembered A dull ease mind From
hill corpsestrewn plain general speaking officers

End Pyrrhus sir

I know sir Ask sir Comyn said

Wait You Armstrong Do know anything Pyrrhus

A bag figrolls lay snugly Armstrongs satchel He curled
palms whiles swallowed softly Crumbs adhered
tissue lips A sweetened boys breath Welloff people
proud eldest son navy Vico Road Dalkey

Pyrrhus sir Pyrrhus pier

All laughed Mirthless high malicious laughter Armstrong looked round
classmates silly glee profile In moment laugh
loudly aware lack rule fees papas pay

Tell Stephen said poking boys shoulder book
pier

A pier sir Armstrong said A thing water A kind
bridge Kingstown pier sir

Some laughed mirthless meaning Two back bench
whispered Yes They knew never learned ever innocent
All With envy watched faces Edith Ethel Gerty Lily Their
likes breaths sweetened tea jam bracelets
tittering struggle

Kingstown pier Stephen said Yes disappointed bridge

The words troubled gaze

How sir Comyn asked A bridge across river

For Hainess chapbook Noone hear Tonight deftly amid wild
drink talk pierce polished mail mind What A
jester court master indulged disesteemed winning
clement masters praise Why chosen part Not wholly
smooth caress For history tale like
often heard land pawnshop

Had Pyrrhus fallen beldams hand Argos Julius Caesar
knifed death They thought away Time
branded fettered lodged room infinite
possibilities ousted But possible seeing
never Or possible came pass
Weave weaver wind

Tell us story sir

O sir A ghoststory

Where begin Stephen asked opening another book

Weep Comyn said

Go Talbot

And story sir

After Stephen said Go Talbot

A swarthy boy opened book propped nimbly breastwork
satchel He recited jerks verse odd glances text

Weep woful shepherds weep
For Lycidas sorrow dead
Sunk though beneath watery floor
It must movement actuality possible possible
Aristotles phrase formed within gabbled verses floated
studious silence library Saint Genevieve
read sheltered sin Paris night night By elbow
delicate Siamese conned handbook strategy Fed feeding brains
glowlamps impaled faintly beating feelers
minds darkness sloth underworld reluctant shy
brightness shifting dragon scaly folds Thought thought
thought Tranquil brightness The soul manner
soul form forms Tranquility sudden vast candescent form
forms

Talbot repeated

Through dear might Him walked waves
Through dear might
Turn Stephen said quietly I dont see anything

What sir Talbot asked simply bending forward

His hand turned page He leaned back went
remembered Of walked waves Here also
craven hearts shadow lies scoffers heart lips
mine It lies upon eager faces offered coin
tribute To Caesar Caesars God Gods A long
look dark eyes riddling sentence woven woven
churchs looms Ay

Riddle riddle randy ro
My father gave seeds sow
Talbot slid closed book satchel

Have I heard Stephen asked

Yes sir Hockey ten sir

Half day sir Thursday

Who answer riddle Stephen asked

They bundled books away pencils clacking pages rustling
Crowding together strapped buckled satchels gabbling
gaily

A riddle sir Ask sir

O ask sir

A hard one sir

This riddle Stephen said

The cock crew
The sky blue
The bells heaven
Were striking eleven
Tis time poor soul
To go heaven
What

What sir

Again sir We didnt hear

Their eyes grew bigger lines repeated After silence
Cochrane said

What sir We give

Stephen throat itching answered

The fox burying grandmother hollybush

He stood gave shout nervous laughter cries
echoed dismay

A stick struck door voice corridor called

Hockey

They broke asunder sidling benches leaping Quickly
gone lumberroom came rattle sticks
clamour boots tongues

Sargent alone lingered came forward slowly showing open
copybook His tangled hair scraggy neck gave witness unreadiness
misty glasses weak eyes looked pleading On
cheek dull bloodless soft stain ink lay dateshaped recent
damp snails bed

He held copybook The word Sums written headline
Beneath sloping figures foot crooked signature
blind loops blot Cyril Sargent name seal

Mr Deasy told write said show
sir

Stephen touched edges book Futility

Do understand asked

Numbers eleven fifteen Sargent answered Mr Deasy said I
copy board sir

Can Stephen asked

No sir

Ugly futile lean neck tangled hair stain ink
snails bed Yet someone loved borne arms
heart But race world would trampled
underfoot squashed boneless snail She loved weak watery
blood drained Was real The true thing
life His mothers prostrate body fiery Columbanus holy zeal
bestrode She trembling skeleton twig burnt
fire odour rosewood wetted ashes She saved
trampled underfoot gone scarcely A poor soul
gone heaven heath beneath winking stars fox red reek
rapine fur merciless bright eyes scraped earth
listened scraped earth listened scraped scraped

Sitting side Stephen solved problem He proves algebra
Shakespeares ghost Hamlets grandfather Sargent peered
askance slanted glasses Hockeysticks rattled
lumberroom hollow knock ball calls field

Across page symbols moved grave morrice mummery
letters wearing quaint caps squares cubes Give hands
traverse bow partner imps fancy Moors Gone
world Averroes Moses Maimonides dark men mien movement
flashing mocking mirrors obscure soul world
darkness shining brightness brightness could comprehend

Do understand Can work second

Yes sir

In long shaky strokes Sargent copied data Waiting always word
help hand moved faithfully unsteady symbols faint hue
shame flickering behind dull skin Amor matris subjective
objective genitive With weak blood wheysour milk fed
hid sight others swaddling bands

Like I sloping shoulders gracelessness My
childhood bends beside Too far lay hand
lightly Mine far secret eyes Secrets silent stony
sit dark palaces hearts secrets weary
tyranny tyrants willing dethroned

The sum done

It simple Stephen said stood

Yes sir Thanks Sargent answered

He dried page sheet thin blottingpaper carried
copybook back bench

You better get stick go others Stephen said
followed towards door boys graceless form

Yes sir

In corridor name heard called playfield

Sargent

Run Stephen said Mr Deasy calling

He stood porch watched laggard hurry towards scrappy
field sharp voices strife They sorted teams
Mr Deasy came away stepping wisps grass gaitered feet When
reached schoolhouse voices contending called He
turned angry white moustache

What cried continually without listening

Cochrane Halliday side sir Stephen said

Will wait study moment Mr Deasy said till I restore
order

And stepped fussily back across field old mans voice
cried sternly

What matter What

Their sharp voices cried sides many forms closed
round garish sunshine bleaching honey illdyed head

Stale smoky air hung study smell drab abraded leather
chairs As first day bargained As
beginning On sideboard tray Stuart coins
base treasure bog ever shall And snug spooncase
purple plush faded twelve apostles preached
gentiles world without end

A hasty step stone porch corridor Blowing
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted table

First little financial settlement said

He brought coat pocketbook bound leather thong It
slapped open took two notes one joined halves
laid carefully table

Two said strapping stowing pocketbook away

And strongroom gold Stephens embarrassed hand
moved shells heaped cold stone mortar whelks money
cowries leopard shells whorled emirs turban
scallop saint James An old pilgrims hoard dead
treasure hollow shells

A sovereign fell bright new soft pile tablecloth

misery

handy

Shakespeare say Put money thy purse

Iago Stephen murmured

He lifted gaze idle shells old mans stare

He knew money Mr Deasy said He made money A poet yes
Englishman Do know pride English
Do know proudest word ever hear
Englishmans mouth

The seas ruler His seacold eyes looked empty bay seems
history blame words unhating

tapped savingsbox thumbnail

For moment Stephen answered

Mr Deasy laughed rich delight putting back savingsbox

I knew couldnt said joyously But one day must feel
We generous people must also

I fear big words Stephen said make us unhappy

Mr Deasy stared sternly moments mantelpiece
shapely bulk man tartan fillibegs Albert Edward prince
Wales

You think old fogey old tory thoughtful voice
said I saw three generations since OConnells time I remember
famine 46 Do know orange lodges agitated repeal
union twenty years OConnell prelates

things

Glorious pious immortal memory The lodge Diamond Armagh
splendid behung corpses papishes Hoarse masked armed
planters covenant The black north true blue bible Croppies lie


Stephen sketched brief gesture

I rebel blood Mr Deasy said On spindle side But
I descended sir John Blackwood voted union We

Soft day honour Day Day Two topboots jog dangling

That reminds Mr Deasy said You favour Mr Dedalus
literary friends I letter press

He went desk near window pulled chair twice read

Sit Excuse said shoulder dictates
common sense Just moment

He peered shaggy brows manuscript elbow
muttering began prod stiff buttons keyboard slowly
sometimes blowing screwed drum erase error

Stephen seated noiselessly princely presence Framed
around walls images vanished horses stood homage
meek heads poised air lord Hastings Repulse duke
Westminsters Shotover duke Beauforts Ceylon prix de
Paris 1866 Elfin riders sat watchful sign He saw
speeds backing kings colours shouted shouts
vanished crowds

Full stop Mr Deasy bade keys But prompt ventilation

mudsplashed brakes amid bawls bookies pitches reek

Now Mr Deasy said rising

He came table pinning together sheets Stephen stood

I put matter nutshell Mr Deasy said Its
foot mouth disease Just look There two
opinions matter

May I trespass valuable space That doctrine laissez faire
often history Our cattle trade The way old
industries Liverpool ring jockeyed Galway harbour scheme
European conflagration Grain supplies narrow waters
channel The pluterperfect imperturbability department
agriculture Pardoned classical allusion Cassandra By woman
better To come point issue

I dont mince words I Mr Deasy asked Stephen read

Courteous offer fair trial Dictates common sense Allimportant

He raised forefinger beat air oldly voice spoke

Mark words Mr Dedalus said England hands
jews In highest places finance press And
signs nations decay Wherever gather eat
nations vital strength I seen coming years As sure
standing jew merchants already work
destruction Old England dying

He stepped swiftly eyes coming blue life passed
broad sunbeam He faced back

Dying said dead

The harlots cry street street
Shall weave old Englands windingsheet
His eyes open wide vision stared sternly across sunbeam
halted

A merchant Stephen said one buys cheap sells dear jew
gentile

They sinned light Mr Deasy said gravely And see
darkness eyes And wanderers
earth day

On steps Paris stock exchange goldskinned men quoting
prices gemmed fingers Gabble geese They swarmed loud
uncouth temple heads thickplotting maladroit silk

slow eyes belied words gestures eager unoffending
knew rancours massed knew zeal vain Vain
patience heap hoard Time surely would scatter A hoard
heaped roadside plundered passing Their eyes knew
years wandering patient knew dishonours flesh

Who Stephen said

What mean Mr Deasy asked

He came forward pace stood table His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly Is old wisdom He waits hear

History Stephen said nightmare I trying
awake

From playfield boys raised shout A whirring whistle goal
What nightmare gave back kick

The ways Creator ways Mr Deasy said All human
history moves towards one great goal manifestation God

Stephen jerked thumb towards window saying

That God

Hooray Ay Whrrwhee

What Mr Deasy asked

A shout street Stephen answered shrugging shoulders

Mr Deasy looked held awhile wings nose tweaked
fingers Looking set free

I happier said We committed many errors
many sins A woman brought sin world For woman
better Helen runaway wife Menelaus ten
years Greeks made war Troy A faithless wife first brought
strangers shore MacMurroughs wife leman
ORourke prince Breffni A woman brought Parnell low Many
errors many failures one sin I struggler

For Ulster fight

White horses white frontlet plumes came round Rotunda corner

large eyes Looking away Sympathetic human man Intelligent
Like Shakespeares face Always good word say They mercy
infanticide Refuse christian burial They used drive

The carriage galloped round corner stopped

quickly Much better close orifices Yes also With wax

Though lost sight Mr Dedalus said memory dear

The carriage steered left Finglas road

The stonecutters yard right Last lap Crowded spit
land silent shapes appeared white sorrowful holding calm hands
knelt grief pointing Fragments shapes hewn In white silence
appealing The best obtainable Thos H Dennany monumental builder
sculptor

Passed

On curbstone Jimmy Geary sextons old tramp
sat grumbling emptying dirt stones huge dustbrown
yawning boot After lifes journey

Gloomy gardens went one one gloomy houses

Mr Power pointed

That Childs murdered said The last house

So Mr Dedalus said A gruesome case Seymour Bushe got
Murdered brother Or said

The crown evidence Mr Power said

Only circumstantial Martin Cunningham added Thats maxim
law Better ninetynine guilty escape one innocent
person wrongfully condemned

They looked Murderers ground It passed darkly Shuttered
tenantless unweeded garden Whole place gone hell Wrongfully
condemned Murder The murderers image eye murdered
They love reading Mans head found garden Her clothing
consisted How met death Recent outrage The weapon used
Murderer still large Clues A shoelace The body exhumed
Murder

Cramped carriage She mightnt like come way
without letting know Must careful women Catch
pants Never forgive Fifteen

The high railings Prospect rippled past gaze Dark poplars
rare white forms Forms frequent white shapes thronged amid
trees white forms fragments streaming mutely sustaining vain
gestures air

The felly harshed curbstone stopped Martin Cunningham put
arm wrenching back handle shoved door open

A team horses passed Finglas toiling plodding tread

So told Terry bring water dog gob could

No rejoined I appreciate full motives
actuate conduct I shall discharge office entrust
consoled reflection though errand one sorrow
proof confidence sweetens measure bitterness
cup

Then suffer take hand said The goodness
heart I feel sure dictate better inadequate words
expressions suitable convey emotion whose
poignancy I give vent feelings would deprive even
speech

aside much filth never would cast
much second thought tear silly postcard dozen
pieces And ever dared presume could give one
look measured scorn would make shrivel spot Miss
puny little Edys countenance fell slight extent Gerty could

Corley first gooff inclined suspect something
Stephen fired digs bringing bloody

Though sort thing went every night near

Mr Bloom meanwhile kept dodging vicinity

The pair parted company Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom

blandiloquence parasite Alluding encounter said
laughingly Stephen

He luck He asked ask ask somebody named
Boylan billsticker give job sandwichman

At intelligence seemingly evinced little interest Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly space half second

moored alongside Customhouse quay quite possibly repair
whereupon observed evasively

Everybody gets ration luck say Now mention

Half crown Stephen responded I daresay needs sleep

intelligence I quite credit assertion I guarantee
invariably Everyone according needs everyone according
deeds But talking things general added

dont mean presume dictate slightest degree
leave fathers house

To seek misfortune Stephens answer

I met respected father recent occasion Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned today fact strictly accurate
yesterday Where live present I gathered course
conversation moved

I believe Dublin somewhere Stephen answered unconcernedly
Why

A gifted man Mr Bloom said Mr Dedalus senior respects
one born raconteur ever one He takes great
pride quite legitimate You could go back perhaps
hasarded still thinking unpleasant scene Westland Row

English tourist friend eventually euchred

There response forthcoming suggestion however
Stephens minds eye busily engaged repicturing

something like

trust boon companion contributes humorous

probability never realised without regular meals Of
course didnt notice much I But wouldnt occasion
least surprise learn pinch tobacco narcotic
put drink ulterior object

He understood however heard Dr Mulligan versatile

exceedingly plucky deed could highly praise
frankly utterly loss fathom earthly reason could
back except put sheer cussedness jealousy
pure simple

Except simply amounts one thing call

The guarded glance half solicitude half curiosity augmented
friendliness gave Stephens present morose expression
features throw flood light none fact
problem whether let badly bamboozled judge
two three lowspirited remarks let drop way saw

conjectured high educational abilities though

Mr Bloom Stephen entered cabmans shelter unpretentious
wooden structure prior rarely ever
former previously whispered latter
hints anent keeper said famous SkintheGoat
Fitzharris invincible though could vouch actual
facts quite possibly one vestige truth A
moments later saw two noctambules safely seated discreet corner
greeted stares decidedly miscellaneous collection
waifs strays nondescript specimens genus homo
already engaged eating drinking diversified conversation
seemingly formed object marked curiosity

Now touching cup coffee Mr Bloom ventured plausibly suggest
break ice occurs ought sample something
shape solid food say roll description

Accordingly first act characteristic sangfroid order
commodities quietly The hoi polloi jarvies stevedores
whatever cursory examination turned eyes
apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual
portion whose hair greyish sailor probably still stared
appreciable time transferring rapt attention

A beautiful language I mean singing purposes Why

Stephen trying dead best yawn could suffering
lassitude generally replied

To fill ear cow elephant They haggling money

inward reflection languages start
absolutely necessary may southern glamour surrounds


The keeper shelter middle têteàtête put
boiling swimming cup choice concoction labelled coffee table
rather antediluvian specimen bun seemed After
beat retreat counter Mr Bloom determining
good square look later appear For
reason encouraged Stephen proceed eyes
honours surreptitiously pushing cup temporarily
supposed called coffee gradually nearer

Sounds impostures Stephen said pause little
time like names Cicero Podmore Napoleon Mr Goodbody Jesus Mr
Doyle Shakespeares common Murphies Whats name

Yes sure Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred Of course Our name
changed added pushing socalled roll across

The redbearded sailor weather eye newcomers boarded
Stephen singled attention particular squarely
asking

And might name

Just nick time Mr Bloom touched companions boot
Stephen apparently disregarding warm pressure unexpected
quarter answered

Dedalus

The sailor stared heavily pair drowsy baggy eyes
rather bunged excessive use boose preferably good old
Hollands water

You know Simon Dedalus asked length

Ive heard Stephen said

Mr Bloom sea moment seeing others evidently
eavesdropping

Hes Irish seaman bold affirmed staring still much
way nodding All Irish

All Irish Stephen rejoined

As Mr Bloom could neither make head tail whole business
asking possible connection sailor
accord turned occupants shelter
remark

I seen shoot two eggs two bottles fifty yards
shoulder The lefthand dead shot

Though slightly hampered occasional stammer
gestures also clumsy still best explain

Bottles say Fifty yards measured Eggs bottles
Cocks gun shoulder Aims

He turned body half round shut right eye completely Then
screwed features someway sideways glared night
unprepossessing cast countenance

Pom shouted

The entire audience waited anticipating additional detonation
still egg

Pom shouted twice

Egg two evidently demolished nodded winked adding
bloodthirstily

A silence ensued till Mr Bloom agreeableness sake felt
like asking whether marksmanship competition like
Bisley

Beg pardon sailor said

Long ago Mr Bloom pursued without flinching hairsbreadth

Why sailor replied relaxing certain extent magic
influence diamond cut diamond might matter ten years He

Still matter cause

Stephen noticed shrugged shoulders merely
remarking

In country people sell much ever

Did host encourage guest chant modulated voice strange

Reassuringly place none could hear talk
secluded reassured decocted beverages allowing subsolid
residual sediment mechanical mixture water plus sugar plus cream

Recite first major part chanted legend

Little Harry Hughes schoolfellows
Went play ball
And first ball little Harry Hughes played
He drove oer jews garden wall
And second ball little Harry Hughes played
He broke jews windows
How son Rudolph receive first part

With unmixed feeling Smiling jew heard pleasure saw
unbroken kitchen window

Recite second part minor legend

Then came jews daughter
And dressed green
Come back come back pretty little boy
And play ball

I cant come back I wont come back
Without schoolfellows
For master hear
Hed make sorry ball

She took lilywhite hand
And led along hall
Until led room
Where none could hear call

She took penknife pocket
And cut little head
And hell play ball
For lies among dead
How father Millicent receive second part

With mixed feelings Unsmiling heard saw wonder jews
daughter dressed green

Condense Stephens commentary

One least victim predestined Once
inadvertence twice design challenges destiny It comes
abandoned challenges reluctant apparition hope
youth holds unresisting It leads strange habitation
secret infidel apartment implacable immolates
consenting

Why host victim predestined sad

He wished tale deed told deed
told

Why host reluctant unresisting still

In accordance law conservation energy

Why host secret infidel silent

He weighed possible evidences ritual murder
incitations hierarchy superstition populace
propagation rumour continued fraction veridicity envy
opulence influence retaliation sporadic reappearance
atavistic delinquency mitigating circumstances fanaticism
hypnotic suggestion somnambulism

From mental physical disorders

From hypnotic suggestion waking recognised

No

Had Blooms coin returned

Never

Why would recurrent frustration depress

Because critical turningpoint human existence desired
amend many social conditions product inequality avarice
international animosity

He believed human life infinitely perfectible eliminating
conditions

There remained generic conditions imposed natural distinct
human law integral parts human whole necessity
destruction procure alimentary sustenance painful character
ultimate functions separate existence agonies birth
death monotonous menstruation simian particularly human
females extending age puberty menopause inevitable
accidents sea mines factories certain painful maladies
resultant surgical operations innate lunacy congenital
criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms make
terror basis human mentality seismic upheavals epicentres
located densely populated regions fact vital
growth convulsions metamorphosis infancy
maturity decay

Why desist speculation

Because task superior intelligence substitute
acceptable phenomena place less acceptable phenomena
