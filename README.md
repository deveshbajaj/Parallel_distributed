# Vectorisation-of-Unstructured-Text-Using-Hadoop
### Vectorization 
data is one of major pre processing method to be implemented on
the data before giving it to the machine as all the machine learning models works on
the vector space model .This preprocessing is help full to form vectors of not only
Text data , as well as image matrix to vectorized and pass it to learning algorithms .
Vectorization is the process of transforming words into numerical representation. It
involves the accumulation of the aggregate vocabulary, mapping that vocabulary to
numeric identifiers, and finally, some arithmetic involving word counts in documents,
and potentially in the collection.
